# 👋 Hello, I'm Ali Hamza

I'm a passionate AI Engineer currently working at [NASTP](https://nastp.gov.pk/alpha) (National Aerospace Science & Technology Park), Islamabad, Pakistan, in the Modeling & Simulation Department. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology from MNS University of Agriculture, Multan.

With a strong background in Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and IoT, I specialize in building intelligent systems for real-world problems. From pest surveillance using AI-powered IoT devices to legal case analysis using GPT APIs, I love working at the intersection of AI and practical applications.
